As I was attending Shanghai Jiao Tong University (or SJTU), in my first two years of undergraduate study, Shanghai becomes the second most familiar place to me besides my hometown [Zhuhai](https://zhihaoruan.xyz/2019/03/05/Zhuhai/). Shanghai has long been regarded as the top 2 big cities in China, as well as a metropolis of all over the world.

Exploring Shanghai turned out to be a lot more interesting than I expected. Besides the traditional landmarks such as Oriental Pearl Tower (Chinese: 东方明珠电视塔), there are a lot of other places that I think could better represent Shanghai vibe. As you scroll down, I hope you'll enjoy these photos.
