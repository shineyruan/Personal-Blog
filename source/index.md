Welcome to my personal website! I am an incoming robotics master's student at the University of Pennsylvania. I received my undergraduate degree in computer science engineering (CSE) at the University of Michigan, with a second degree in electrical and computer engineering (ECE) at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. You can find a short story about me [here](https://shineyruan.github.io/about/). A copy of my CV is attached at the end of introduction.
