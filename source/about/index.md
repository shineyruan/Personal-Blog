Greetings! Nice to meet you! I'm Ryan, a computer science engineer. I love everything that is equipped with fancy, high-end technology. I'm also a photographer, strongly interested in capturing everything that is beautiful and important in my daily life. As you go into my blog, I would like to share some long stories with you. Let's make friends!

## About me

I come from South China, the city of Zhuhai, Guangdong Province. Zhuhai is a really peaceful and lovely city by the sea. Walking on the seashore, you can always feel the warm sunshine and the wind breeze. The air is fresh, often mixed with the smell of the fish &mdash; there is always a lot of people fishing there. Fish, shrimps and scallops make up a really large proportion of my childhood memory. I remember so clearly that everyday after work, my parents always went to the local fish market, and bought some really fresh fish home for dinner. The passion for fish in my family leads to one of my greatest habits: I love seafood very, very much.

I spent my first 18 years in this beautiful city, and went through my primary school and middle school life. When I was in the 7<sup>th</sup> grade, I had a chance to learn programming. Although the programming language I learned was `Pascal`, which is no longer used today, the programming experience really gave me a solid ground on data structures and algorithms. I once got the 3<sup>rd</sup> prize for the National Olympiad of Informatics in Provinces (NOIP), which is a great award at that time. From the coding experience, I have formed a good habit &mdash; I am never afraid of learning any new programming languages, and I always tend to think deeply about how a complicated system gets to work. 

After middle school, I went to [Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU)](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/), which is one of the top 4 universities in China. There, I began my academic career. After my sophomore year, I was successfully enrolled in a dual-degree program, and came to the University of Michigan, which is where I am now. Throughout all the time in the university, I had quite a lot of project experience, and each of them has greatly improved one of my skills. These project experience will be elaborated in detail in other posts.

I'm also fond of travelling and photography. On one hand, travelling is a great activity that helps me get rid of my current surroundings for a while and get a chance to explore new things. You know, when people have been in an environment for too long, they would easily be stuck and get bored. On the other hand, I'm quite open to different cultures and styles and I'm eager to explore as many different cultures as possible in my life, which could help broaden my horizons. As for photography, as a recording tool, this is a great way for me to document what I saw as well as my experiences in the past; as a type of art, it is also a perfect way for me to express my emotions. I have set up a ["My Gallery" category](https://zhihaoruan.xyz/categories/My-Gallery/) in my blog which will update irregularly (sorry!) to document what I saw, and how I was feeling.

Besides, I'm also a big fan of badminton. I started to play badminton when I was in the 7<sup>th</sup> grade, and have always been playing since then. Playing badminton has long been my main way to relax. I really enjoy the pace, the speed, and the feelings of shooting. I have also made a lot of friends from playing badminton. I am always trying out new strategies while playing a game to improve my skills. Would you like to play with me?
