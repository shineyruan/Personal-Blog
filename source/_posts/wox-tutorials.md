For Windows users, the biggest problem is that Windows system does not provide them with an efficient search engine for local file searching. Although the efficient Cortana search may cover part of the job, there is still no way for it to search for an arbitrary file in an arbitrary disk (or even Google Drive, if you had Google Drive File Stream) from the computer. In this post, I would recommend a light but efficient software for local file search called *Wox*.

# What is Wox?

[*Wox*](http://www.wox.one/) is a free, open-source effective launcher for Windows system that enables users to find applications and files on their own computers at a very high speed. It also provides quick search over the Web, such as searching questions on Google, Bing, etc. It even provides a simple calculator in its command prompt in which you can perform simple calculations. All these nice functions can be accessed via only a shortcut key (may be `Alt+Space`), so it is very easy to use and very powerful.

# Integrating with *Everything*

Actually, Wox does not have a search engine on its own. It has to run based on a free, powerful search engine called [*Everything*](https://www.voidtools.com/en-us/). *Everything* is a very popular light software for local file search. As long as it indexes all the files and folder on your computer and builds its own database once, it can provide quick search over all files and folders on your computer, no matter how many disks you have.
