Of all the places I've been to, Zhuhai, by no doubt, is the most special one to me. As I grew up, countless changes have taken place in this city. People went and people came, and the city developed fast.

As a photographer, I have the feeling that it is my responsibility to record her changes every time I return. I really hope that my hometown can become better and better.

Xiangzhou District is one of the oldest area in Zhuhai, which originates from a tiny village 40 years ago. It is still the political, financial and cultural center of Zhuhai. Just like the countless other alleys, most of the food stalls here have a very long history, and any of them is able to satisfy your appetite.*

*A typical old supermarket in Zhuhai. When I was small, my parents used to take me here every day after school. For six consecutive years, I bought a lot of things here: new LEGO toy bricks, new shoes, new pens and pencils, new bags, and of course, delicious snacks. This supermarket was once owned by [JUSCO (Chinese: 吉之岛)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JUSCO), but now the ownership has been transferred to a new corporation called AEON (Chinese: 永旺).*
