Ann Arbor is the place for me to pursue my second bachelor's degree in the University of Michigan. It is a small but lovely town located in the south of the State of Michigan. While I was taking classes and working on the campus, I would also like to record those tiny little pieces of happiness in daily life with my lenses. These pictures help to keep my precious memories.

*The crossing of Plymouth Rd and Upland Rd on North Campus. There was a beautiful sunset one afternoon, and at this crossing there was a broad view of the scenery. Watching the busy cars running on the street gives me a sense of life.*
