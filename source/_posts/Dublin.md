# Street Performers in Downtown Dublin

To my great surprise, street performing seems to be a very popular activity in Dublin. Walking in the streets in the city you could find a lot of street performers playing all kinds of musical instruments.

"The Twenty Tour" is one of the major concert tours of Westlife after their reunion. I could hardly find a proper word to describe my excitement at the concert due to my poor vocabulary. It was really exciting, magnificent, and wonderful.
