*During the spring break of 2019, I went to the City of Dearborn for a short trip. Dearborn is famous for the headquarters of Ford Motor Company. Although I did not stay long in town, I did take a nice picture of a beautiful sunset on the street. Broad streets, small houses, running cars, traffic lights, sunset... This is a very typical scene in North America.*
