Starting from 2019, my main development environment has turned from Visual Studio to Visual Studio Code. Although part of the reason is that I have to find a way to use Linux environment in Windows for my school work, the main reason is that I'm fascinated with its small installation size and great open-source extensions support (I don't want a dual system due to the small amount of available disk space on my PC; nor do I want a virtual machine as it is far too slow). Now, let's take a close look at this amazing editor and feel its magic power.

# What is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)?

Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a small streamlined code editor with support for development operations like debugging, task running and version control. It mainly aims to offer a quick code-build-debug cycle for developers without any other redundant, unnecessary features. Therefore it is a perfect tool for writing small programs. However, due to a more and more extensive extension support in [*Visual Studio Marketplace*](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/), it also becomes more and more suitable for developing small, even middle-sized applications. Basically, you can make this tiny editor support almost all popular programming languages in the world simply by installing extensions from the Marketplace.

However, there are also a few notations:

* VS Code is, in essence, just an ***editor***. Therefore, in order to compile codes in it, some external compilers must be installed onto your system.
* VS Code is famous for its quick and convenient write-compile-run development cycle, so it is not efficient to build a complex application in it. It is created to competed with other code editors such as [Vim](https://www.vim.org/), [Atom](https://atom.io/) and [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/), but not big IDEs such as [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/).
