Along with Dublin, I also visited the second-largest city in Ireland, Cork, and the famous Cliffs of Moher, during my trip to Ireland last summer.

# Cork

Although Cork has been the second largest city of Ireland, it is still relatively small and looks more like a peaceful town. In Cork there is a famous English market where all kinds of Atlantic seefood, meat, fruits, and flowers are sold. The city was small but really peaceful, with a small river passing through the city center.

# Cliffs of Moher

Cliffs of Moher faces towards the great Atlantic Ocean. It is a wonderful place with magnificent views.
